# Codeable Reviews and Expert Profile Plugin

WordPress plugin for front end display of Codeable expert information

Stores expert and review information from the API in transients to lower number of server calls
* Expert Information (1 day)
* Reviews (4 hours)

## Sample Usage

[expert_reviews codeable_id=31044 number_to_pull=50 min_score=5 show_x_more=5 min_review_length=1 loading=lazy]

(stores 50 latest reviews, then shows the 5 most recent that have a score of 5 and at least some message with the review. Uses native Chrome lazyloading)

## Gutenblocks (New!)

I've added 3 Gutenberg Blocks (picture, button, and reviews list), with all options from the shortcode below. These are still a work in progress! If you are so inclined to try them out, please let me know how they work for you. Keep an eye out for updates to these, as far as layout and structure.

## Shortcodes (codeable_id att required):

| Shortcodes       | Item to Insert       |
|:------------- |:-------------|
| [expert_reviews codeable_id=31044] | shows reviews |
| [expert_image codeable_id=31044] | profile image |
| [expert_completed codeable_id=31044] | # of completed projects |
| [expert_rating codeable_id=31044] | average rating |
| [expert_hire codeable_id=31044] | button to hire |

## Optional Atts
### Optional atts: expert_reviews
* number_to_pull, defaults to 20, how many reviews to save from the api (can control how many show with show_x_more)
* show_title=yes to show task title, defaults to no
* show_date=yes to show review date, defaults to no
* show_rating=no to hide the rating (default is show)
* min_score, only shows reviews above and including this score (blank is no min)
* max_score, only shows reviews below and including this score (blank is no max)
* sort=rand, sorting options, valid value is just rand for now. Default is no sorting (profile page order)
* start_at (default 1), useful for chunking in offsets. (Does not work for now with random)
* show_x_more (default is show all), show the next x reviews (from offset if set, or from start).
* min_review_length (default is show all), number of characters minimum in review message to show the review. Set to 1 to hide blank reviews, or larger number to hide short reviews. 
* has_picture, set to "yes" to hide all reviews that use the default profile image (may break if default no profile images switches, I will have to fix manually if so)
* filter_clients, comma seperated list of client IDs to exclude from display
* filter_reviews, comma seperated list of review IDs to exclude from display
* only_clients, comma serpated list of client IDs to exclusively display (other filters still apply)
* only_reviews, comma serpated list of review IDs to exclusively display (other filters still apply)
* schema=yes Enable structured data using json-ld (aggregate review, review markup) (yes to enable, only use this once per page for now)
* schema_desc="Your description here" (default is: Custom WordPress work through Codeable.io)
* start_time (unix timestamp, will only show reviews published after this time)
* end_time (unix timestamp, will only show reviews published before this time)
* loading (set value to lazy to lazy load natively for Chrome)
* cache (set value to "yes" to locally cache profile pictures, uses file_get_contents on first run)

### Optional atts: expert_image
* circle=yes , default is yes shows image as a circle
* class=your-class , add a custom extra class to the image tag for easier styling
* loading (set value to lazy to lazy load natively for Chrome)
* cache (set value to "yes" to locally cache profile pictures, uses file_get_contents on first run)


### Optional atts: expert_hire
* message="Your Message", defaults to "Hire Me"
* referoo=xxxxxx, defaults to empty
* class=your-class, optional extra class to add to the link to make styling easier
* theme=black sets a button theme: valid values are black, white, or anything else for no theme (defaults to black)

### No optional atts on expert_completed or expert_rating

## Future Goals / Plans

* Blocks: Work out additional styling options / make them more useful
* Blocks: Build pre-formatted blocks combining shortcodes (number of tasks, picture, average) in a nice layout.
* Additional sort options
* Impliment a "default" expert ID, referoo code as plugin settings (still could be overwritten on a shortcode level)
* Continue to tweak and optimize code / display as needed
* Look at some sort of local caching of images to cut down on external calls to AWS
